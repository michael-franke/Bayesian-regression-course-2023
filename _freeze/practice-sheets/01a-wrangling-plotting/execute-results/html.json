It is rich and fun.\n\nWe will be analyzing data from Experiment 1 of the following paper:\n\nScherbaum, S., & Kieslich, P. J. (2018). Stuck at the starting line: How the starting procedure influences mouse-tracking data. Behavior Research Methods, 50(5), 2097-2110.\n\n[https://osf.io/7vrkz/](link%20to%20OSF)\n\nIt's a methodological paper but it replicates a very intuitive finding. When you are categorizing animals into types (e.g. a 'dog' into the type 'mammal'), you perform better when the animal is prototypical (dog \\--\\> mammal) as opposed to atypical (dolphin \\--\\> mammal). This 'performing better' is measured in different ways: reaction time, accuracy (correct vs. incorrect) and several measurement of the cursor movement toward the correct answer.\n\n## Loading and inspecting the data\n\nThe data is part of the `aida` package, but we can give it a fancy new name:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndolphin <- aida::data_MT\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo get some information about the data set, we can use the `help` function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhelp(\"data_MT\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nHere is some more information we can get about the data:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# number of rows in the data set\nnrow(dolphin)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2052\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# number of columns in the data set\nncol(dolphin)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 16\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# names of the columns\nnames(dolphin)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] \"X1\"               \"trial_id\"         \"MAD\"              \"AUC\"             \n [5] \"xpos_flips\"       \"RT\"               \"prototype_label\"  \"subject_id\"      \n [9] \"group\"            \"condition\"        \"exemplar\"         \"category_left\"   \n[13] \"category_right\"   \"category_correct\" \"response\"         \"correct\"         \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# number of unique `subject_id`s\ndolphin$subject_id |> unique() |> length()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 108\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# number of types each subject saw different `conditions`\ndolphin |> with(table(subject_id, condition)) |> head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n          condition\nsubject_id Atypical Typical\n      1001        6      13\n      1002        6      13\n      1003        6      13\n      1004        6      13\n      1005        6      13\n      1006        6      13\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n``` {head(dolphin)}\n```\n\n## A closer look at the columns\n\nLet's take a closer look at the columns and the information inside them.\n\nWe can get a `glimpse` of all columns like so:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(dolphin)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 2,052\nColumns: 16\n$ X1               <dbl> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16…\n$ trial_id         <chr> \"id0001\", \"id0002\", \"id0003\", \"id0004\", \"id0005\", \"id…\n$ MAD              <dbl> 82.53319, 44.73484, 283.48207, 138.94863, 401.93988, …\n$ AUC              <dbl> 40169.5, 13947.0, 84491.5, 74084.0, 223083.0, 308376.…\n$ xpos_flips       <dbl> 3, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1,…\n$ RT               <dbl> 950, 1251, 930, 690, 951, 1079, 1050, 830, 700, 810, …\n$ prototype_label  <chr> \"straight\", \"straight\", \"curved\", \"curved\", \"cCoM\", \"…\n$ subject_id       <dbl> 1001, 1001, 1001, 1001, 1001, 1001, 1001, 1001, 1001,…\n$ group            <chr> \"touch\", \"touch\", \"touch\", \"touch\", \"touch\", \"touch\",…\n$ condition        <chr> \"Atypical\", \"Typical\", \"Atypical\", \"Atypical\", \"Typic…\n$ exemplar         <chr> \"eel\", \"rattlesnake\", \"bat\", \"butterfly\", \"hawk\", \"pe…\n$ category_left    <chr> \"fish\", \"amphibian\", \"bird\", \"Insekt\", \"bird\", \"fish\"…\n$ category_right   <chr> \"reptile\", \"reptile\", \"mammal\", \"bird\", \"reptile\", \"b…\n$ category_correct <chr> \"fish\", \"reptile\", \"mammal\", \"Insekt\", \"bird\", \"bird\"…\n$ response         <chr> \"fish\", \"reptile\", \"bird\", \"Insekt\", \"bird\", \"bird\", …\n$ correct          <dbl> 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1,…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere is a quick explanation of all the different columns:\n\n-   `trial_id` = unique id for individual trials\n-   `MAD` = maximal deviation into competitor space\n-   `AUC` = area under the curve\n-   `xpos_flips` = the amount of horizontal direction changes\n-   `RT` = reaction time in ms\n-   `prototype_label` = different categories of prototypical movement strategies\n-   `subject_id` = unique id for individual participants\n-   `group` = groups differ in the response design (click vs. touch)\n-   `condition` = category membership (Typical vs. Atypical)\n-   `exemplar` = the concrete animal\n-   `category_left` = the category displayed on the left\n-   `category_right` = the category displayed on the right\n-   `category_correct`= the category that is correct\n-   `response` = the selected category\n-   `correct` = whether or not the `response` matches `category_correct`\n\n# Some basic data wrangling\n\nAlthough the data set is already in good shape, here are some excursions into common steps to wrangle data (select, filter, reshape, summarize ...).\n\n## Selecting columns\n\nFor now, we are only interested in columns `RT`, `group`, `condition`, `category_correct`, and `correct`.

Let's get the means and standard deviations of the reactions times for each level in the variable `condition`. We also include the minimum and maximum values for each condition.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndolphin_aggregate <-\n  dolphin_filter3 |>\n  group_by(condition) |>\n  summarise(\n    min_RT  = min(RT),\n    mean_RT = mean(RT, na.rm = T),\n    sd_RT   = sd(RT, na.rm = T),\n    max_RT  = max(RT)\n    )\n  # the na.rm = T is an argument that is used to tell R that NAs should be ignored \n  # when calculating the summary statistics\n\n# show the aggregated df\ndolphin_aggregate\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  condition min_RT mean_RT sd_RT max_RT\n  <chr>      <dbl>   <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl>\n1 Atypical     630   2149. 1840.  19903\n2 Typical      510   1665. 1283.  20685\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo we find that atypical categories are responded to slower than typical categories. Makes sense. Identifying a dolphin as a mammal might be difficult because it shares a lot of features with fish.\n\nWe can group according to many different factors simultaneously, and we can create multiple summary statistics at the same time. Here, we get summary statistics for each combination of all levels in variables `condition` and `group`. We use the `tidyboot` package to get bootstrapped 95% confidence intervalls. (Notice that these are more informative than standard deviations in the sense that they give an upper and lower deviation, not just one number for both directions, which can be misleading when the data is skewed (like reaction times typically are)):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndolphin_aggregate2 <-\n  dolphin_filter3 |>\n  group_by(group, condition) |>\n  summarize(\n    lower_CI = tidyboot::ci_lower(RT),\n    mean_RT  = mean(RT, na.rm = T),\n    upper_CI = tidyboot::ci_upper(RT)\n    )\n\n# show the aggregated df\ndolphin_aggregate2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 4 × 5\n# Groups:   group [2]\n  group condition lower_CI mean_RT upper_CI\n  <chr> <chr>        <dbl>   <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 click Atypical     1030.   2417.    7311.\n2 click Typical       950    1847.    4698.\n3 touch Atypical      750    1900.    5368.\n4 touch Typical       686.   1486.    3955.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see here that the group that needed to click on a response are overall slower than touch responses, but also much more variable in their behavior.\n\n## Changing and adding columns\n\nOften, we are interested in standardized measures because we do not know what a value of 1 means on any given scale. Is 1 a large difference or a small difference? For example when we want to explore the impact of several predictors on the same measurement, we want to know the relative size of a number. To achieve this, we standardize measures by dividing their mean by their respective standard deviations. We will use the `scale()` function for this and create a new variable in our data frame via `mutate()`.\n\n(Note that the `scale()` function creates an object that is of the matrix class. That is fine for the most part but might create issues later on. To avoid any issues, we wrap the `scale()` function in `as.numeric()` to store the results as a numeric vector.)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndolphin_standardize <-\n  dolphin_selected |>\n  mutate(RT_scale = as.numeric(scale(RT)))\n  \nhead(dolphin_standardize)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n     RT group condition category_correct correct RT_scale\n  <dbl> <chr> <chr>     <chr>              <dbl>    <dbl>\n1   950 touch Atypical  fish                   1   -0.552\n2  1251 touch Typical   reptile                1   -0.373\n3   930 touch Atypical  mammal                 0   -0.564\n4   690 touch Atypical  Insekt                 1   -0.706\n5   951 touch Typical   bird                   1   -0.551\n6  1079 touch Atypical  bird                   1   -0.475\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf we now compare, say atypical and typical categories according to reaction times, we can use the standardized RT ratings.

Let's start very simple. Let's plot a bar plot. Let's also add a title to our plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dolphin_agg, aes(x = condition, y = mean_RT)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  ggtitle(\"a bare bar plot\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01a-wrangling-plotting_files/figure-html/barebar-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n  # stat = \"identity\" takes the number in the dataset as the bar height (as opposed to a 'count')\n```\n:::\n\n\nUgh! What an ugly plot, right? But it's already telling a story: Atypical categories are responded to slower than typical categories. Let's add a measure of uncertainty, in our case the bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, as error bars to the plot:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dolphin_agg, aes(x = condition, y = mean_RT)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") + \n  \n  # this is the added layer\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_CI, \n                    ymax = upper_CI), \n                colour = \"black\",\n                linewidth = 0.5) +\n  \n  ggtitle(\"a bare bar plot with error bars\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01a-wrangling-plotting_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can observe a couple of things here. First, ggplot automatically adjust the axes based on the elements to be plotted unless we tell it not to. Second, the error bars are plotted *in front* of the bars, i.e. closer to the viewer. This visual ordering reflects the order of layers. We first plotted the bars and THEN the error bars.\n\nBeyond bar plots, we can create other useful plots types. For example a point plot. Instead of a bar, we plot the mean RT as points.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dolphin_agg, aes(x = condition, y = mean_RT)) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_CI, \n                    ymax = upper_CI), \n                colour = \"black\") +  \n  # this is the new geom \n  geom_point() +\n  ggtitle(\"a point plot\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01a-wrangling-plotting_files/figure-html/point1-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOr a line plot that connects the means with a line. For the line plot to work, we need to indicate a `group` aesthetic, i.e. the group that we want to connect with a line. If you have for example several interacting categories, you need to indicate which groups are supposed to be connected with lines (see below). Because we have only one group here, condition, we set `group` to `1`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dolphin_agg, aes(x = condition, y = mean_RT, group = 1)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  ggtitle(\"a line plot\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01a-wrangling-plotting_files/figure-html/line1-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYay, we are on a roll. Let's plot a box plot. Remember the box shows the median (middle vertical line) and the interquartile range (the middle 50% of the data within the box). Note that for the box plot, we do not plot aggregated values, so we need to refer to the *entire* data set. We also add the aesthetic `fill` here and set it to the variable `condition` to color code our boxes.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# we changed the dataset referred to\nggplot(dolphin, aes(x = condition, y = RT, fill = condition)) +\n  # this is the new geom \n  geom_boxplot() +\n  ggtitle(\"a box plot\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01a-wrangling-plotting_files/figure-html/box1-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhile the above plots illustrate one continuous variable (`RT`) plotted against a categorical variable (`condition`), we can also plot two continuous variables against each other. For example, we could plot `RT` against `AUC` in a scatter plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# we changed the y aesthetic to `Hardness`\nggplot(dolphin_subset, aes(x = RT, y = AUC)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  ggtitle(\"a scatter plot\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01a-wrangling-plotting_files/figure-html/scatter1-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFinally, one central plot type for our class. The density plot. It plots on the x-axis a continous value and on the y-axis the \"density\"\" of these values. So high values on the y-axis means a lot of data at the corresponding x-values. The density curve can be outlined with `color` and filled with `fill`. To keep the two categories visually distinct, we add an argument to the `geom_density()` function: alpha. Alpha controls the transparency of the color! We will see a lot of these density plots in our class.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dolphin, aes(x = RT, color = condition, fill = condition)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  ggtitle(\"a density plot\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01a-wrangling-plotting_files/figure-html/density1-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Adjusting plot elements\n\nOkay, so we are now already capable of exploring our data visually with a bunch of plots. These plots are exceptionally ugly and of limited communicative value so far. Note that this is perfectly fine during an exploratory phase of data analysis. If we just eye-ball data and we have no trouble interpreting the plots, thats just fine. However, as soon as we want to communicate patterns to others with these graphs, we need to take a little bit more care of its communicative value. Let's look at ways we can tailor our plots to the needs of an audience.\n\nLet's go back to our bar plot and explore whether `condition` and `group` has an impact on `RT`?\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# First we aggregate RT for group and condition\ndolphin_agg2 <- dolphin_subset |>\n  group_by(group, condition) |>\n  summarise(mean_RT = mean(RT),\n            sd_RT = sd(RT))\n\n# then we plot and color code for condition (note that, for bar plots, the aesthetic of `color` refers to the border of the bar, and `fill` refers to the actual colour of the bar)\n\nggplot(dolphin_agg2, aes(x = condition, y = mean_RT, fill = group)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01a-wrangling-plotting_files/figure-html/bar3-1.png){fig-align='center' width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHm... that doesn't work out, the bars are on top of each other, we need to tell ggplot to position the bars next to each other instead. We do that with position_dogde(). Note that ggplot assigns a default color coding scheme to your plots if you don't specify it by hand.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dolphin_agg2, aes(x = condition, y = mean_RT, fill = group)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01a-wrangling-plotting_files/figure-html/bar4-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAwww much better! Alternatively, we can plot the two categories into separate panels. We achieve this by facetting using the `facet_grid()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dolphin_agg2, aes(x = group, y = mean_RT, fill = condition)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge()) +\n  # this is the facetting function\n  facet_grid(~ condition)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01a-wrangling-plotting_files/figure-html/bar5-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOkay. We are getting somewhere. We already learned something again. Apparently, the effect of typiciality on RT is pretty similar across tasks. It does not look like we have an interaction here (more on interactions later).\n\nNow let's make these plots ready to communicate information. We add appropriate axes titles. Note that we are using a little hack here: The \"\\n\" inserts an empty line, creating visual distance from axis title to axis, thus making it easier to read it. Our audience will thank us.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dolphin_agg2, aes(x = group, y = mean_RT, fill = condition)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge()) +\n  facet_grid(~ condition) +\n  # add axis titles\n  xlab(\"\\n task\") +\n    ylab(\"mean response latency in ms\\n\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01a-wrangling-plotting_files/figure-html/bar6-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe same graph as a point / line plot indicated to the audience whether there is an interaction pattern or not. Note that here we do not facet because we actually want the points to be plotted within the same horizontal space. We also have to specify the group aesthetic to tell ggplot which points to connect with lines.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dolphin_agg2, aes(x = group, y = mean_RT, color = condition, group = condition)) +\n  # instead of geom_bar we use geom_point and geom_line\n  geom_point(size = 12) +\n  geom_line(size = 2) +\n  xlab(\"\\n task\") +\n  ylab(\"mean response latency in ms\\n\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01a-wrangling-plotting_files/figure-html/line2-1.png){fig-align='center' width=768}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n  # # need to change to the color aesthetic instead of fill\n  # scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), breaks = (c(0, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000)), limits = c(0,3000))\n```\n:::\n\n\nThese lines look pretty parallel and don't indicate a strong interaction pattern. But how do different exemplars differ? Let's aggregate for individual exemplars first and then create the same plot for the means of all exemplars.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndolphin_agg3 <- dolphin_subset |> \n  group_by(exemplar, group, condition) |> \n  summarise(mean_RT = mean(RT, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nggplot(dolphin_agg3, aes(x = group, y = mean_RT, color = condition, group = exemplar)) +\n  # instead of geom_bar we use geom_point and geom_line\n  geom_point(size = 6, alpha = 0.3) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_label(aes(label = exemplar)) +\n  xlab(\"\\n task\") +\n  ylab(\"mean response latency in ms\\n\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01a-wrangling-plotting_files/figure-html/line3-1.png){fig-align='center' width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt looks like \"shark\" and \"rattlesnake\" behave very different from their buddies in the `typical` condition. Interesting! We wouldn't have noticed if we had only looked at the overall means.\n\n## Exercises for plotting\n\nTake the scatter plot below as a departure point.
