We want to predict probabilities for each category $p_1, \\dots, p_k$ (with some linear predictors, more on this in a moment). To obtain the probabilities, we estimate a set of weights (so-called *logits*): $s_1, \\dots, s_k$. By default, we set $s_1 = 0$. (We only need $k-1$ numbers to define a $k$-place probability vector (given that it must sum to one).) For all $1 \\le i \\le k$, we define the probability $p_i$ of category $i$ via the following (so-called *soft-max* operation):\n\n$$\np_i = \\frac{\\exp s_i}{ \\sum_{j=1}^k \\exp s_j}\n$$\n\nThis entails that for every $1 < i \\le k$, the score $s_i$ can be interpreted as the log-odds of category $c_i$ over the reference category $c_1$:\n\n$$\ns_i = \\log \\frac{p_i}{p_1}\n$$\n\nFinally, we do not just estimate any-old vector of logits, but we assume that each logit $s_i$ ($1 < i \\le k$) is estimated as a linear predictor (based on the usual linear regression predictor coefficients, appropriate to the type of the $l$ explanatory variables):\n\n$$\ns_i = \\beta^i_0 + \\beta^i_1 x_1 + \\beta^i_2 x_2 + \\dots + \\beta^i_l x_l\n$$\n\nTwo things are important for interpreting the outcome of a multinomial regression fit:\n\n1.  each category (beyond the reference category) receives its own (independent) set of regression coefficients;\n2.  the linear predictor predictor $s_i$ for category $c_i$ can be interpreted as the log-odds of the $i$-th category over the first, reference category.\n\n## Example\n\nOur next research question is slightly diffuse: we want to explore whether the distribution of trajectory types is affected by whether the correct target was on the right or the left. We only consider three types of categories (curved, straight and 'change of mind') and prepare the data to also give us the information whether the 'correct' target was left or right.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndolphin_prepped <-\n  dolphin |>\n  mutate(\n    prototype_label = case_when(\n     prototype_label %in% c('curved', 'straight') ~ prototype_label,\n     TRUE ~ 'CoM'\n    ),\n    prototype_label = factor(prototype_label,\n                             levels = c('straight', 'curved', 'CoM')),\n    target_position = ifelse(category_left == category_correct, \"left\", \"right\")\n    )\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe relevant data now looks as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndolphin_prepped |> \n  select(prototype_label, target_position)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 2,052 × 2\n   prototype_label target_position\n   <fct>           <chr>          \n 1 straight        left           \n 2 straight        right          \n 3 curved          right          \n 4 curved          left           \n 5 CoM             left           \n 6 CoM             right          \n 7 CoM             right          \n 8 straight        left           \n 9 straight        left           \n10 straight        left           \n# … with 2,042 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe counts and proportions we care about are these:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum_stats <- dolphin_prepped |> \n  count(target_position, prototype_label) |>\n  group_by(target_position) |> \n  mutate(proportion = n / sum(n))\n\nsum_stats\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n# Groups:   target_position [2]\n  target_position prototype_label     n proportion\n  <chr>           <fct>           <int>      <dbl>\n1 left            straight          751     0.734 \n2 left            curved            136     0.133 \n3 left            CoM               136     0.133 \n4 right           straight          793     0.771 \n5 right           curved             93     0.0904\n6 right           CoM               143     0.139 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd here is a plot that might be useful to address your current issue:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum_stats |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = prototype_label, y = proportion, fill = prototype_label)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  facet_grid(. ~ target_position)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03a-GLM-tutorial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt is hard to say from visual inspection alone, whether there are any noteworthy differences.
