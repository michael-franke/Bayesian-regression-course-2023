The first session introduces the basics of BDA and linear regression modeling.
We will also have a first rendez-vous with the data set which most of our hands-on monkeying will be based on.
This also allows to recap a bit of wrangling and plotting in the tidyverse.

Here are [slides for session 1](slides/01-intro-simpleRegress.pdf).
