The first session introduces the basics of BDA and linear regression modeling.

Here are [slides for session 1](slides/01-intro-simpleRegress.pdf).

There are two hands-on exploration and exercise sheets.
The first is a crash-course (or recap) of basic wrangling and plotting in the tidyverse.
Here, we will also have a first rendez-vous with the data set (mouse-tracking data) which most of our hands-on monkeying will be based on.
The second sheet covers Bayesian simple linear regression (using `brms`).
